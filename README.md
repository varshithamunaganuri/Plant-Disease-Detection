# Plant Disease Detection

## About the Project
Plant Disease Detection is a Machine Learning–based web application designed to identify plant leaf diseases using image classification.  
Users can upload a leaf image, and the system predicts whether the leaf is healthy or diseased and displays the disease name along with basic prevention details.  
This helps in early detection and supports farmers and agriculture students in improving crop health.

## Features
- Instant prediction results  
- Simple and user-friendly interface
- Works for 14 crops 
- Displays disease name

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Flask Web Framework  
- Machine Learning Image Classification (CNN Model)  
- HTML and CSS for Frontend  

## How to Run the Project
1. Download or Clone the repository on your computer  
2. Open the project folder in VS Code or any IDE  
3. Install required libraries  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application  

## Dataset
The dataset used for training is collected from publicly available plant disease image datasets found on open platforms such as Kaggle and other open-source datasets.  
Images include multiple plant species with healthy and diseased leaf categories.

## Future Improvements
- Show disease name and prevention details in multiple languages  
- Suggest recommended medicines or treatments based on disease type  
- Add more plant species and disease categories  
- Deploy the application online for public use  
- Improve model accuracy with larger dataset
